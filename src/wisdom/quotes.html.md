## Stoicism

### Enchiridion by Epictetus (125)

https://enchiridion.tasuki.org/display:Code:ec,twh,pem

> Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control [..] are
> our own actions. Things not in our control [..] are not our own actions.

> Remember that following desire promises the attainment of that of which you
> are desirous; and aversion promises the avoiding that to which you are
> averse. However, he who fails to obtain the object of his desire is
> disappointed, and he who incurs the object of his aversion wretched. 

> [..] if you desire any of the things which are not in your own control, you
> must necessarily be disappointed; and of those which are, and which it would
> be laudable to desire, nothing is yet in your possession.

> Whatever moral rules you have deliberately proposed to yourself, abide by

> any of them. Don't regard what anyone says of you, for this, after all, is no
> concern of yours.

## Transcendentalism

### Nature by Emerson (1836)

https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29433

> In the woods, we return to reason and faith. There I feel that nothing can
> befall me in life [..] which nature cannot repair. Standing on the bare
> ground [..] all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball; I am
> nothing; I see all;

### Walking by Thoreau (1851)

https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1022

> I am alarmed when it happens that I have walked a mile into the woods bodily,
> without getting there in spirit. [..] What business have I in the woods, if I

## Environmentalism

### Our National Parks by John Muir (1901)

https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/60929

> Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find
> out that going to the mountains is going home; that wildness is a necessity;
> and that mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of
> timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains of life. 

### A Sand County Almanac by Aldo Leopold (1949)

> That land is a community is the basic concept of ecology, but that land is to
> be loved and respected is an extension of ethics. 

<!---->

> Ability to see the cultural value of wilderness boils down, in the last
> analysis, to a question of intellectual humility. 

<!---->

> A land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the
> land-community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his
> fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such.

<!---->

> Conservation is a state of harmony between men and land.

<!---->

> Examine each question in terms of what is ethically and esthetically right,
> as well as what is economically expedient. A thing is right when it tends to
> preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is
> wrong when it tends otherwise. 

### Silent Spring by Rachel Carson (1962)

> Future historians may well be amazed by our distorted sense of proportion.
> How could intelligent beings seek to control a few unwanted species by a
> method that contaminated the entire environment and brought the threat of
> disease and death even to their own kind? Yet this is precisely what we have
> done.

<!---->

> Future generations are unlikely to condone our lack of prudent concern for
> the integrity of the natural world that supports all life.
