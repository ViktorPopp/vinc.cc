# Lalolelo

Lalolelo is a constructed language inspired [Polynesian languages][1].

## Phonology

The syllable structure is CV(V).

#### Vowels

|       | Front | Central | Back |
| ----- | :---: | :-----: | :--: |
| Close |   i   |         |  u   |
| Mid   |   e   |         |  o   |
| Open  |       |    a    |      |

#### Consonants

|             | Labial | Alveolar | Velar | Glottal |
| ----------- | :----: | :------: | :---: | :-----: |
| Nasal       |   m    |    n     |       |         |
| Plosive     |   p    |    t     |   k   |         |
| Fricative   |   f    |    s     |   x   |    h    |
| Approximant |        |    l     |       |         |

Compared to [Proto-Polynesian][2], the velar nasal /ŋ/ that became a glottal
stop /ʔ/ in Tahitian is a velar fricative /x/ in Lalolelo, and the labial
approximant /w/ that became a labiodental fricative /v/ in Samoan and Tahitian
is an alveolar fricative /s/ in Lalolelo.

## Morphology

In this language, words are formed by compounding root words.

## Syntax

I wanted initially to have a VSO (verb-subject-object) word order for this
language given its strong Polynesian influence but I'm starting with a classic
SVO (subject-verb-object) for simplicity given my background in French,
English, and Spanish. The Celtic language of my ancestors, Breton, is also a
VSO so I might revisit this decision later, although recent generations of
Polynesians are also influenced by English and French word orders.

I also decided that noun-phrases and verb-phrases would always have a
modifiers-noun and modifier-verb order.

## Lexicon

The lexicon is small and roughly based on the [Swadesh list][3] translated in
[Samoan][4], [Maori][5], [Tahitian][6], [Hawaiian][7].
