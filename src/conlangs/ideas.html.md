# Conlang ideas

I've been thinking about two conlangs for years now, which I'll call L1 and L2:

* L1 is a common language for low-tech communities that are responsible for
  preserving the wilderness.

* L2 is a common language for a high-tech culture that is responsible for
  preserving human knowledge. L1 is a subset of L2.

This space-faring culture would live in large rotating space habitats, or in
underground bases on Mercury, Mars, Luna, and Ganymede, but also on dirigibles
above the clouds of Venus, in giant high-density areas around a few space
elevators along the equator on Terra, and in a multitude of small villages
along the coasts and rivers of its continents.

They will use spaceships to travel through space, but on Terra, they would also
use sailboats and dirigibles. Most of Terra and many space habitats would be
dedicated to preserving the wilderness after realizing that humans are just one
species among all the others and that our main role is to be stewards of Terran
life.

The culture will also preserve human knowledge by keeping alive the ancient
wisdom from Stoicism, Buddhism, and other philosophical traditions that can
guide us toward a more peaceful and sustainable life while helping us achieve a
balance between high-tech and low-tech.

## L1

L1 is a simple conlang inspired by Toki Pona with a vocabulary sounding like
some Polynesian languages (Samoan, Tahitian, Māori) with a touch of Celtic
languages, perhaps the result of an imaginary encounter in the middle of an
ocean from two sea-faring cultures at the opposite sides of the home planet.

### Morphology

In this language, words are formed by compounding root words.

### Syntax

I was tempted to have a VSO (verb-subject-object) word order for this language
given its Polynesian and Celtic influence but I'm starting with a classic SVO
(subject-verb-object) for simplicity.

A noun-phrase and a verb-phrase always have a modifiers-noun and modifier-verb
order.

## L2

L2 is a more complex conlang inspired by Lojban with a vocabulary derived from
major Indo-European languages that have been used as a common language at some
point:

- Indic (Sanskrit, Pali)
- Italic (Latin, French, Spanish)
- Hellenic (Ancient Greek)
- Germanic (English)
