# Reviewing April 2024

The first part of the month was again spent working on [MOROS][0]:

- Add Intel PRO/1000 PT ([#612](https://github.com/vinc/moros/pull/612))
- Reduce DHCP sleep time ([#610](https://github.com/vinc/moros/pull/610))
- Fix HTTP server buffer ([#609](https://github.com/vinc/moros/pull/609))
- Fix HTTP server content type ([#608](https://github.com/vinc/moros/pull/608))
- Allow copying files to dirs ([#607](https://github.com/vinc/moros/pull/607))

Later in the month the weather finally turned warm and sunny so I spent most of
my days outside working on my bonsai garden, and at night I updated the
[bonsai pages](https://vinc.cc/bonsai) of my personal website.
