# Updates for September 2023

This month I started working on [Geonde](https://geonde.com), an environmental
platform for green computing.

I've been exploring recently what I could do to help make cloud computing more
sustainable and one interesting area is carbon aware software using data from
the [electricity grid](https://geonde.com/api/electricity/emissions?countries=ch,de,es,fr,ie,it,se,uk)
and [weather forecasts](https://geonde.com/api/weather/forecast/paris).

The prototype is pretty basic for now but it is reusing things that I coded
almost a decade ago for an [abandoned project](https://github.com/vinc/forecastfor.me).

During the launch of Geonde I had to update and rebuild some of my other apps
hosted on the same server in a hurry to avoid too much downtime. I took this
as an opportunity to add a dark mode to [News Search](https://news.vinc.cc)
after I updated its version of Bootstrap. I use dark mode a lot at night and
I was really missing it on this app.

And finally I released a new version of [MOROS](http://moros.cc) on the day of
the autumnal equinox which was the object of my [previous post](/news/2023/09/23/moros-0-10-1-released/).
