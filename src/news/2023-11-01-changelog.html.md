# Reviewing October 2023

This month I finished the prototype for [Geonde](https://geonde.com), an
environmental platform for green computing that I started last month.

I also created a landing page for [CloudWaste](https://cloudwaste.net), an
idea for a related green computing project to help people
[stop wasting cloud resources](https://stop.wasting.cloud).

And finally I worked on a [fix](https://github.com/vinc/geodate/pull/62) for
dates before 1900-01-01 on my [lunisolar calendar](https://github.com/vinc/geocal/pull/3).
I also fixed the [Geodate](https://geodate.org) website that couldn't be built
from source anymore.
