# Reviewing May 2024

This month was like last month in reverse. While the weather was fine I was
still working in the bonsai garden, then the rain arrived I switched back to
working on [MOROS][0]:

- Created a text viewer derived from the text editor ([#629][629])
- Improved the network logs ([#628][628])
- Refactored the color API ([#625][625])
- Changed markdown files to `text/plain` in the HTTP server ([#622][622])
- Added a recursive mode to the `hash` command ([#621][621])
- Added device file creation to the `write` command ([#620][620])
- Refactored the installation script ([#619][619], [#623][623], [#626][626])
- Fixed a comparison issue between Lisp numbers ([#618][618])

The summer solstice release will have a good amount of change.
