# Reviewing July 2024

At the end of June and in the first part of July, I resumed working on my old
idea of a conlang inspired by [Toki Pona][1], [Lojban][2], and Polynesian
languages. I decided to name it [Faeke][3], and I spent a lot of time looking
at Samoan, Maori, Tahitian, and Hawaiian dictionaries to build the root words
of the language. It was fun! I'm now freezing the conlang to try making
sentences with what I have for a while, and next time I'll build a little
website introducing an alpha version of Faeke.

After that, I had a great time with shortwave radio on my [RTL-SDR][4]. I put a
long wire between the garden shed and a tree and could listen to a lot of
stations from America, Africa, and Asia. I had not done this in many years, and
it was a surprise to hear China broadcasting from so many frequencies.

I also experimented again with a tin can gasifier stove for my green tea break
late in the afternoon. It's interesting to boil hot water with just a few twigs
without producing any smoke once the stove gets going.

Not much coding; it felt a bit like a summer holiday at home.
