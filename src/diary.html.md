# Diary of Vinc

Welcome to my public diary!

The dates are expressed using a lunisolar calendar that I published around
0114-00-00 or 2014-01-01 in the gregorian calendar. The starting date
0000-00-00 of the calendar is equivalent to 1900-01-01.

## 0122-05-03

Today a guy from one of the village came to dig a trench on the North and the
East sides of the house to help draining water.

Lots of house related things since the last entry. We demolished the overly
massive fireplace of the future kitchen that was the main room of the farm
house and watched the old fireplace appear behind it. We disassembled an old
staircase to put a new one at another place. And finally we removed some heavy
stones behind the staircase leading to another room to avoid having to climb
up and down when changing room. We also did another trip to the next bigger
town to buy lots of material.

In the past few days I was mostly offline. We bought the material to build the
fences to have horses for a couple of weeks in the middle of the orchard to
manage the grass that has not been cut in 2 or 3 years. And today I mowed the
areas around the around the house for the second time, 10 days after the first.

Today I joined a few public access Unix systems from the tildeverse to discover
what people have been doing over the past years for hosting their content and
socializing as an alternative to Facebook, Twitter, and the other giant social
networks.

I had planned to finish working on the `socket` command for MOROS this week
but instead most of my computer time outside of work is being spent exploring
the tildeverse, a kind of decentralized community across multiple shared
servers.

Most of the content on the web has been produced with monetization in mind, and
it has become very hard to find something that is free of that influence. There
are some exceptions of course in the form of wikis and forums but only the big
websites show up on search engines, the small alternatives are lost in the
noise. I can see that easily when I search for my own content.

I tried a few times in the past decade to step out of the web and explore
content hosted on gopher but I didn't know where to look and never found
something that would make me come back.

A couple of days ago I have become aware of gemini, a new protocol for
displaying textual content that I somehow missed, and this led me to a very
interesting place where people are experimenting with something different from
the web we have today and more like what we had at the beginning two or three
decades ago.
