# About
Hi, I’m Viktor Popp, a passionate software developer specializing in systems programming and operating system development. I’m the creator of InfinityOS, an experimental cross-platform operating system written in Rust, designed to push the boundaries of performance, security, and modern design principles.

With a strong foundation in Rust, I enjoy diving deep into low-level programming, exploring the intricacies of hardware-software interaction, and tackling the challenges of building robust systems from scratch. Inspired by projects like Philip Opperman’s OS tutorial, I aim to make complex topics accessible to others while continuously learning and innovating.

When I’m not writing code, you’ll find me exploring emerging technologies, sharing knowledge with the developer community, or brainstorming new ways to optimize and scale systems.

Let’s build something extraordinary together!
