# About

I took my first breath in this world about `449 947 500` seconds after Unix
Epoch at `48.500` degrees of latitude and `-2.753` of longitude in Brittany. My
childhood was spent between the sea and the forest, and I remain, more than a
gigasecond later when writing the first draft of this text, most at peace when
I am surrounded by nature.


## Education

At some point in my childhood, I discovered another world made of silicon and
binary numbers, and it immediately clicked for me as I was typing my first
commands in the console of a computer.

I made my first personal website for fun in the year 1998 of the Gregorian
calendar at the age of 14 years old, and the first one for profit 2 years
later.

Since then the internet got bigger and a lot more complex, but I'm still
pushing code to web servers. I gained in the process a master degree in
computer science with a specialization in network engineering at the University
of Rennes I, and a love for efficient and elegant code.


## Work

After graduating from the university, I moved to Paris to work for
[Slate.fr][0] and I was thankful for the forest of Fontainebleau to keep me
sane during the weekend and the rail network to explore the forests and
mountains of Europe a few weeks every year. But that wasn't enough for me, I
needed the presence of the wilderness in my daily life.

So I flew to the other side of the world and spent two years traveling around
in Aotearoa, Samoa, and Australia while working remotely on [Reader.fr][1].
During this time I explored some of the most stunning wilderness of the planet
and met wonderful people living off the grid in sustainable communities.

This experience reinforced in me the belief that there are a lot of things we
can do today to fix the disconnect between ourselves and nature, and take
better care of our planet.

After that I came back to Europe, worked for [Paris.fr][2] for a year while
I was looking for a land next to one of the forests where I grew up, and
finally settled there when I found it.

I am now rewilding half of that land and doing permaculture on the rest while
working remotely for [Augment.com][3]. I am also involved in activism in the
form of nonviolent civil disobedience actions, because protesting the current
system and proposing alternatives goes hand in hand.

I am at times available for remote work as a full stack web developer but not
at the moment. Still, if you have an interesting and meaningful project in Ruby
or Rust, I'd love to hear about it.
