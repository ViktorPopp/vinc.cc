# MOROS: Obscure Rust Operating System

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinc/moros/master/doc/images/moros.png)

MOROS is a hobby operating system written in Rust by [Vincent Ollivier](https://vinc.cc).

It targets computers with a x86-64 architecture and a BIOS, so mostly from 2005
to 2020, but it also runs well on most emulators (Bochs, QEMU, and VirtualBox).

This project started from the [seventh post][1] of the second edition of
[Writing an OS in Rust][2] by Philipp Oppermann and by reading the
[OSDev wiki][3] along with many open source kernels.

## Documentation

Documentation is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinc/moros/master/doc/index.md)


## Setup

You will need `git`, `gcc`, `make`, `curl`, `qemu-img`, and
`qemu-system-x86_64` on the host system.

Clone the repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/vinc/moros
    $ cd moros

Install the required tools with `make setup` or the following commands:

    $ curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- -y --default-toolchain none
    $ rustup show
    $ cargo install bootimage


## Usage

Build the image to `disk.img`:

    $ make image output=video keyboard=qwerty

Run MOROS in QEMU:

    $ make qemu output=video nic=rtl8139

Run natively on a x86 computer by copying the bootloader and the kernel to a
hard drive or USB stick (but there is currently no USB driver so the filesystem
will not be available in that case):

    $ sudo dd if=target/x86_64-moros/release/bootimage-moros.bin of=/dev/sdx && sync

MOROS will open a console in diskless mode after boot if no filesystem is
detected. The following command will setup the filesystem on a hard drive,
allowing you to exit the diskless mode and log in as a normal user:

    > install

**Be careful not to overwrite the hard drive of your OS when using `dd` inside
your OS, and `install` or `disk format` inside MOROS if you don't use an
emulator.**


## Tests

Run the test suite in QEMU:

    $ make test
