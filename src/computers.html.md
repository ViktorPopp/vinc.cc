# Computers

This page list the computers I used during my life. It's quite personal and
might not be really useful to anyone else. I had no computers until I was
around 10 years old and from then on I most often had more than one.

### Epson PC AX Portable / Equity LT-256 (1990)

- CPU: Intel 286 (8-12 MHz)
- RAM: 640 KB
- HDD: 20 MB

This was the first computer I grew up with, it came from an uncle somewhere
between 1994 and 1996. It was a heavy laptop with a black and white screen.
It was running MS-DOS 4.0 originally. I still have its manual.

I played Prince of Persia a lot on it. It moved to my bedroom at some point and
I remember coding games and some TUI things with [QBasic][1]

### IBM PS/1 2121 (1991)

- CPU: Intel 386 SX (20 MHz)
- RAM: 2 MB
- HDD: 40 MB (Maxtor 7040AI)

I'm not completely sure about the [model][2] but I still have the 40 MB hard
drive and the manual with a note saying "Type 2121". I vaguely remember the
processor to be the 20 MHz model but it could have been 16 MHz.

It was our first desktop computer with a color screen. It came from a friend of
my father at work I think. We probably got it around 1996. It was running
Windows 3.1 and I played many games on it. I remember the many installation
disks needed for the system.

Discovering Prince of Persia in color with a better sound was incredible.
I remember fondly playing Another World many times, and Wolfenstein 3D a bit
later, but maybe it was on the next computer.

### Epson Equity 386DX/25

- CPU: Intel 386 DX (25? MHz)
- RAM: 8 MB
- HDD: 43 MB (Seagate ST351A/X)

Our third computer, I remember it even less except that it was a 386 DX. It was
a bit more powerful with more memory. I think it was this [model][3] because I
still got the keyboard (N860-4871-T004 / 9347) that might have come with it.
Although it is from the end of 1993 which is a bit late. My earliest picture
of this keyboard is from 2003.

It might have been running Windows 3.11 but I'm not sure.

### ??

- CPU: Intel 486 DX (33? MHz)
- HDD: 340 MB (Conner CFA-340A)

My father got me this computer from his workplace, and it allowed me to play
better games like Syndicate and SimCity 2000. I don't remember much about it.

I got an external CDROM drive for this or another computer to read CDs from
magazines.

I have a picture from 2003 where I can see an AOpen Computer Mainboard box for
what could be the motherboard for this computer, which would mean it was just a
kit?

### Custom PC 1

- CPU: Intel Pentium (75 MHz)
- RAM: 16 MB
- Mobo: Intel Advanced/ZP

My uncle gifted me the CPU+RAM+Mobo kit at some point and it was my main
computer for a few years. I'm not sure about which hard drive it got.

There was a dip switch on the motherboard to select the CPU, and mine could
work with the 90 MHz setting. That was my first overclocking.

I have a picture from 2002 of a computer case that might have housed this kit,
or the 486. But I can see the motherboard at another location in the bedroom
on the picture.

### Packard Bell Multimedia (1998)

- CPU: Intel Pentium II (233 MHz)
- GPU: ATI 3D Rage Pro
- RAM: 32 MB
- HDD: 3.2 GB (Quantum Fireball SE)
- CDR: 32x (NEC CDR-28B)
- Mobo: Intel AL440LX

I'm not sure about the exact model because the few I could find online were
[similar][3] [but][4] [not][5] [quite][6] matching:

- Packard Bell MultiMedia XLE 2411 (wrong HDD, wrong gpu, right modem, wrong cdrom)
- Packard Bell Multimedia XL 2413 (right HDD, right gpu, no modem, wrong cdrom)
- Packard Bell Multimedia XLE 2417 (wrong HDD, right gpu, wrong modem, right cdrom)

This was the first computer my father bought from a store in March 1998. It was
a big deal, it was running Windows 95 and we could play incredible games on it
like Age of Empire or Half-Life at the end of the year. There was a lot of
software bundled with it so we discovered a lot of new things at once.

We got a 56k modem with it and used AOL CDs to connect to the Internet. I built
my first website during the summer and announced it on Usenet from that
computer. Although the actual coding was done in my bedroom from another
computer. I remember vividly coding my website when France won the soccer
world cup and listening to the noise from the window.

We replaced or added another hard drive to the PC around 1999 but I can't
remember which one of the following drives:

- 4.3 GB (WD Caviar 14300 / 1999-03-30)
- 6.4 GB (WD Caviar 26400 / 1998-11-25)
- 13 GB (Seagate Medalist 13032 / 9950)

I remember the first more than the others but that would not be a big jump in
capacity. Some similar Packard Bell models have a 4.3 GB drive but this one was
made one year after the computer so we didn't started with it. My best guess
would be the 13 GB drive because I can see it next to the CD ROM drive in most
pictures after 2003.

In 2003 I got this computer in my bedroom and promptly extracted it from its
case, it became my Linux computer with Mandrake 9.1 at first and Debian after
that.

I wrote somewhere that I boosted it to 384 MB of RAM and that I had a 3dfx
Voodoo graphic card on it but that might have been on the Epox BX6 because I
still have a 64+256 MB of RAM on the motherboard. But this Packard Bell could
indeed accept 384 MB of RAM (3x128 MB).

### Custom PC 2 (2001)

- CPU: Intel Celeron II (600 MHz)
- GPU: GeForce2 MX
- Mobo: Abit BE6-II

I replaced the motherboard once, then switched to an Abit BF6, and ended on
a Epox BX6 with an adapter that was still allowing me to overclock the
processor. The many changes of motherboards was due to the capacitor plagues
of that era and at one time I was not able to use this computer for almost a
year.

The processor on this computer was incredible. It could be overclocked from
600 MHz at 1.50 V to 900 MHz at 1.75 V, and even 1008 MHz at 1.95 MHz. I could
go higher like 1053 MHz at 2.05 V but it was not stable at that frequency.

I was fascinated by the idea of pushing the processor to its limit and got
someone to build me an aluminum bloc to setup a watercooling system. I managed
to push it to 1098 MHz at 2.30 V with this system. I could have went further
because I bought a 172 W Peltier module for that but it didn't manage to power
it successfully. Instead the module went to my previous Pentium 75 system.

I also managed a pretty nice overclocking on my graphic card with a voltage mod
to push it from 175/166 to 275/266 but it didn't last long at that frequency.

I was able to run Quake III on this computer, that was a big deal. I also
played a lot at the older Half-Life and we did LAN parties with the Packard
Bell and many bots. I remember other games like SimeCity 3000, the Civilization
series, and more until I stopped around 2003 when I switched to Linux.

In 2004 I got a Pentium III 700 for this computer and it became my file server
for many years when it moved with me for studying at the university from 2005
to 2010. The watercooling system didn't follow me but I was very nostalgic of
that era. I still got the motherboard with me in 2023 but it's no longer
running anything.

### Custom PC 3 (2005)

- CPU: AMD Athlon XP Palomino 2000+ (1667 MHz)
- RAM: 512 MB
- Mobo: ASRock K7VT6

I built another PC to go in my apartment while I was studying Computer Science
at the university. I got a second hand CPU from a guy in a small forum with a
slightly newer motherboard and an Antec SLK3700 computer case, my first and
last real case in a long while because a cardboard case was not good enough
this time.

The processor could be overclocked to 1933 MHz to become equivalent of an
Athlon XP 2300+ that was never commercialized.

### Custom PC 4 (2006)

- CPU: AMD Athlon XP Barton 2500+ (1833 MHz)
- RAM: 1 GB
- Mobo: ASUS A7N8X-X

The previous PC died suddenly which ended my two years career playing OGame
online at a high level. It was very frustrating the day it happened and
liberating soon after to be free from having to connect all the time to the
game. A friend sold me his old processor and motherboard so I could upgrade my
PC at a low cost. I was a good PC and lasted until I finished studying at the
university in 2010 but the lack of 64 bit support and dual-core ended up
limiting.

The processor could be overclocked to 2200 MHz easily to become equivalent to
an Athlon XP 3200+ that was more expensive. A year later I boosted mine further
to 2442 MHz.

### Asus Eee PC 1005HA-H (2009)

- CPU: Intel Atom N280 (1600 MHz)
- RAM: 1 GB
- HDD: Hitachi Travelstar 160 GB

This was my first netbook. I loved the small form factor and it became fast
enough once I replaced the HDD by an Intel SSD and upgraded the RAM to 2 GB.

### ASUS EeeBook E202SA (2017)

- CPU: Intel Pentium N3710 (1600 MHz)
- RAM: 4 GB

I got this netbook for my second year in New Zealand when the first one stopped
working. I liked having more memory and a quad-core, this was a new era for me.
I immediately replaced the HDD by another Intel SSD but the RAM and the battery
was soldered on the motherboard, I hated that!

### Lenovo ThinkPad T440p (2013)

- CPU: Intel Core i5-4300M (3300 MHz)
- RAM: 4 GB

This was my next laptop, In 2022 wanted something powerful, cheap, and fully
repairable so instead of buying new I got this 9 years old laptop and it was
perfect! It is only a dual-core but with 2 threads per core it's not an issue.

I upgraded the memory to 16 GB and replaced the HDD with a SSD as
usual to make it fast. At first I got a WD Blue SA510 but it died so I
replaced it by a Samsung 870 EVO than seems more reliable.

This laptop can be opened with just 2 screws, I really like that.

### Lenovo ThinkPad T480 (2018)

- CPU: Intel Core i5-8350U (3600 MHz)
- RAM: 8 GB

In 2023 I wanted to test the last generation of ThinkPad that was still fully
repairable to have a cheap backup laptop. It is a quad-core which is a nice
upgrade from the previous ThinkPad.

The memory can officially be upgraded to 16 GB but in practice the laptop will
accept 64 GB while the newer models are much more limited because the memory is
soldered on the motherboard. I only got one stick of 32 GB though because 40 GB
is more than enough for me but I might upgrade in the future. I also bought a
Samsung 980 MZ to have 1 TB of fast storage.

It is lighter and slimmer than the T440p but it's less easy to open it.
The screen is better but I don't need the higher resolution and my Linux
configuration is not well adapted to it.
