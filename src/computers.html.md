- Mobo: MSI B550 Tomahawk

- Storage:
  - SSD: Samsung 970 256 GB
  - HDD: ? (But it was very slow)

This was the first computer I grew up with, it was my dads and he got it in
between 2010 and 2018. It was an ugly black box that was standing on the dusty
floor beneath his desk.

I remember playing with HTML and CSS to make my own website. I also played
Fortnite a lot on it with my frends
