## Computing

- Computers from 10 years ago are just as effective as current models for
  personal tasks. While older computers were more repairable, they were less
  energy-efficient. New computers should be designed to last for decades.

- Improved monitoring and management of cloud resources could potentially
  [reduce energy waste][1] by up to 30%.

## Food

- Adopting a vegan diet in Europe could [double the amount of forests][2] and
  create extensive wilderness areas, providing the necessary space to
  effectively protect biodiversity.

- Using a wood gas stove fueled by garden twigs can be more efficient for
  cooking than using electrical induction stoves. A solar stove is even better
  when the sun is shining.

## Space

- Humans have always been technological, we've been burning the land and
  hunting species to extinction since the beginning. The advent of industrial
  society has only accelerated the process. Our best hope is to spread out
  among the stars and bring the rest of the biosphere with us by maintaining
  half of our habitats as protected wilderness.
