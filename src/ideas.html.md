## Computing

- Computers from 10 years ago are just as effective as current models for
  personal tasks. While older computers were more repairable, they were less
  energy-efficient. New computers should be designed to last for decades.

- Improved monitoring and management of cloud resources could potentially
  [reduce energy waste][1] by up to 30%.

## Food

- Adopting a vegan diet accross Western Europe could [double forest coverage][2]
  and create vast wilderness areas, providing the necessary space to effectively
  protect biodiversity.

- Using a wood gas stove fueled by garden twigs can be more efficient for
  cooking than using electrical induction stoves. A solar stove is even better
  when the sun is shining.

## Space

- Humans have always employed technology, from ancient practices of
  land-burning and overhunting to the transformative agricultural and
  industrial revolutions, each stage amplifying our impact on Earth. Our best
  hope is to spread out among the stars and bring the rest of the biosphere
  with us by designating half of our habitats as protected wilderness.
