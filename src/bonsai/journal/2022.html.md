## TODO

## 2024-05-10

Pyracantha coccinea #1 is covered in flowers and Rhododendron indicum chinzan #1
has started flowering.

## 2024-06-01

I removed the flowers from Rhododendron indicum hanazono #1.

## 2024-07-08

I cut the trunk of Olea europaea sylvestris #1.

## 2024-07-10

I cut the trunk of Ficus retusa #1 just above the first branch (one year later
I can say it reacted very well). I also shortened the branch of Olea europaea #1.

## 2022-10-31

I prunned Acer palmatum #1 and Acer buergerianum #1 at leaf fall.

## 2022-11-13

I drilled two holes in the trunk of Acer palmatum #1 and moved two branches
through them to try to graft them (next Spring they didn't leaf out, the buds
dried out).

## 2022-12-11

I did a branch selection pruning on the latest Chinese orm.
