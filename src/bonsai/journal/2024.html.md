There was a tiny amount of snow on the trees this morning.

The Chinese quinces and the Acer palmatum katsura are leafing out already.

I reassembled the bonsai tables and moved the trees that were on the ground
over the winter onto them. I also moved the wintering (olive, privet, chojubai)
trees out of the greenhouse.

I received 111 seeds of Pinus thunbergii (2g) from Semences du Puy and I put
them in a glass of water.

Most of the seeds (108) fell to the bottom of the glass so I discarded those
that were still floating and put the rest in a bag with a bit of wet moss that
I moved to the fridge.
