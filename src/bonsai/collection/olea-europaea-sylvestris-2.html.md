# Olea europaea sylvestris #2

## September 2020

This 15 years old pre-bonsai was ordered from [Mistral Bonsai](https://www.mistralbonsai.com)
near Tarragona in the Northeast of Spain.

The tree is now in a cold greenhouse for the winter with all the other
Mediterranean trees.

In March the tree already restarted growing in the greenhouse so I repotted it
in 100% pumice in a pond basket. It was previously growing in nursery compost.

I also [pruned](/images/bonsai/2021-03-06-olea-europaea-sylvestris-1-pruned.jpg)
the branches that won't be needed in the future but I kept a lot of options
open.

The tree is growing very vigorously and is now as dense as last year. I am
currently considering various trunk chops because the trunk is very straight
and denuded above the first branches. A chop just above that level in summer
will produce a lot of new shoots but a chop bellow will lead to very interesting
taper.
