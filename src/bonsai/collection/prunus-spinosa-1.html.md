# Prunus spinosa #1

There are a few areas in the garden where blackthorn are densely growing and
must be managed to avoid colonising all the surrounding land. This is a great
opportunity to collect bonsai material.

This one was digged up in late March, it had one big root connecting it to the
other blackthorns that had to be cut along with all the shoots starting from
the root mass.

It was hard to read the rings of the big root I cut but I'd guess the tree to
be at least around 15 years old at the time of collection.

The tree had a good first flush but then it stopped growing except for
[suckers from the base of the trunk](/images/bonsai/2020-07-17-prunus-spinosa-1.jpg).

I repotted the tree to check the roots, a few new ones where produced around
the big cuts and shoots. The previous one where very long tube so I reduced
them to near the trunk, hopping the new ones will allow the tree to stay alive.
I also removed some dead wood.
