# Malus domestica #2

## November 2020

This wild apple tree has been heavily damaged every year by deer and hares and
it's very weak as a result. A few others are in the same situation in the
garden and I decided that they would be better off growing in pots.

I waited until its leaves had fallen and collected it.

The root system is not perfect but I expect it to improve over time because
this species can produce new roots very easily.

The trunk has some nice features.

And a low branch is conveniently placed to become the new leader.

The tree will spend the winter in a cold greenhouse and hopefully bounce back
in Spring.
