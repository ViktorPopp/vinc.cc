I bought a little Chinese elm in a store for 10 euros to make a bonsai out of
very cheap material.

The first step was to remove its organic substrate and pot it into a 1/1/1
akadama, pumice, and lava mix after a [drastic pruning](/images/bonsai/2021-04-30-ulmus-parfolia-2-pruning.jpg) of its roots.
