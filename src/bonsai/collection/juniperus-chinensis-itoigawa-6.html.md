After experimenting with wiring and compacting three [itoigawa](/bonsai/collection/juniperus-chinensis-itoigawa-1)
[junipers](/bonsai/collection/juniperus-chinensis-itoigawa-2) ordered from
[Maillot Bonsai](https://www.maillot-bonsai.com), near Lyon in the Southeast of France,
that turned out a bit too tick for 5 years old cuttings, I tried again with 2
and 3 years old cuttings ordered from the same place.

This time it was much easier to get what I wanted.

I'll plant the first three on the ground, and the other ones on medium size
containers and let them grow for a few years.
