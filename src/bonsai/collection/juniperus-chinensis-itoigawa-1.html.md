This is the first of three itoigawa junipers that I ordered from
[Maillot Bonsai](https://www.maillot-bonsai.com), near Lyon in the Southeast of France,
to experiment with junipers and propagate them via cuttings in the coming
years.

They were 5 years old and already a bit too tick for the kind of very compacted
shape I had in mind for them, but if I let them grow large enough they should
be okay.

This one was ticker than the others, without any first branch that could
replace the main trunk, so I picked it up first to wire it and see how it'd go.

The result was not too bad. The other two were then planned to get wired a few
weeks or months after seeing how this one react.
