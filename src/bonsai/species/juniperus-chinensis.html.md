One of the most popular variety of Juniperus chinensis is known as shimpaku
juniper or Juniperus chinensis sargentii in botanical Latin. It has been
discovered just about a century and a half ago in Japan, but since then it has
been over-collected and it is now almost extinct in the wild.

A special kind of shimpaku called itoigawa was discovered by a collector around
Mount Kurohime near the city of Itoigawa and its qualities soon lead to a very
high demand causing its disappearance from the area. But it is possible to find
trees in nurseries that initially came from cuttings of those collected
specimens.

## Varieties

- Itoigawa
- Kishu

## Propagation

### Cutting

- Take cuttings in mid-spring to benefit from a longer growing season
- Cut at a 45-degree angle to increase the surface area, using a sharp razor blade
- Add a piece of wire to secure the cutting if needed
- Fill a pot with fine substrate particles and water it
- Create holes about the same size as the cuttings
- The base of the cutting should be at the middle depth of the pot
- Place the pot out of the wind and intense sun
- Mist once or twice a day
- Repot the cuttings into separate containers next spring

## Notes

The foliage may turn brown following a frost but will revert to green with the
arrival of spring.
