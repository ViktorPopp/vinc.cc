One of the most popular variety of Juniperus chinensis is known as shimpaku
juniper or Juniperus chinensis sargentii in botanical Latin. It has been
discovered just about a century and a half ago in Japan, but since then it has
been over-collected and it is now almost extinct in the wild.

A special kind of shimpaku called itoigawa was discovered by a collector around
Mount Kurohime in the island of Sado and its qualities soon lead to a very high
demand causing its disapearance from the area. But it is possible to find trees
in nurseries that initially came from cuttings of those collected specimens.
