# Juniperus chinensis (Chinese juniper)

## Varieties

- Itoigawa
- Kishu

One of the most popular variety of Juniperus chinensis is known as shimpaku
juniper. It was discovered around 1850 near Mount Ishizuchi in Japan, but it
has been over-collected over the next half-century and became almost extinct in
the wild.

A special kind of shimpaku called itoigawa was then discovered by a collector
on Mount Kurohime near the city of Itoigawa in the first decade of 1900 and its
qualities soon lead to a very high demand also causing its disappearance from
the area. But it is possible to find trees in nurseries that initially came
from cuttings of those collected specimens.

## Propagation

### Cutting

- Take cuttings in mid-spring to benefit from a longer growing season
- Cut at a 45-degree angle to increase the surface area, using a sharp razor blade
- Add a piece of wire to secure the cutting if needed
- Fill a pot with fine substrate particles and water it
- Create holes about the same size as the cuttings
- The base of the cutting should be at the middle depth of the pot
- Place the pot out of the wind and intense sun
- Mist once or twice a day
- Repot the cuttings into separate containers next spring

## Notes

The foliage may turn brown following a frost but will revert to green with the
arrival of spring.
