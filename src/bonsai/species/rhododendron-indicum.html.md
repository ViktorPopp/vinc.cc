  - No direct sun in winter when it's freezing to avoid damaging the bark
- https://live.bonsaimirai.com/library/video/azalea-repotting (video by Peter Warren)
  - Repot before the new leaves come out when doing serious work (feb-apr)
  - Post-flowering repotting was traditionnaly done in Japan but not anymore
    become the summer heat is too hard on the trees
  - Repot in a 3-years cycle or 4-years in cold climate
  - Use kanuma with a bit of pumice added to help against compaction
