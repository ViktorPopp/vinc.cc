  - must be watered as soon as the soil gets dry
  - larger branches can be pruned in spring before the new buds open
  - when the new shoots have matured they are shortened to two leaves
  - if trees are pruned in autumn or winter take care to keep buds on the twigs because otherwise they will dry back
  - should be repotted every two years in spring before the new buds open

  - repotting every 2 or 3 years, at the beginning of the spring sprouting
  - akadama 100%, or mixed with volcanic clay (30%)
  - structural pruning can be performed in winter
  - when new shoots have reached up to 10 leaves, cut down to leave only the 2 first leaves

  - first year after a big pruning in winter let it grow until Aug/Sep then cut it back like a hedgerow
  - second year a first trimming of the top in May/Jun to let the bottom grow, then same as last year in Aug/Sep
  - same thing for another 1 or 2 years
  - then detailed design with a fine scissor in Oct/Nov

  - when growing on the ground, dig up the tree every three years to cut the big roots
  - the following growth season will be much slowed down while the tree focus on roots
  - the second year is good for structural pruning or collection because of the new fine roots
  - the third year prune both in winter and in June to allow light inside the tree
  - when chopping the tree to select a new leader, remove all the buds above it in August
  - air layering is possible to create a new nebari: remove a 5mm ring of bark in February, let it dry a few days in a cold room, place a wire of the same size and use akadama + moss
  - when cutting a big root, create a drop shape on the trunk going up to form a better scar
  - when growing in a pot, contrary to the ground, wait until the end of winter to repot and cut roots
  - drastic root pruning is possible but keep enough buds on the tree, they will all be needed
  - with a lot of leaves and not enough roots, the tree will react by creating a lot of fine roots, even more so when using fine substrat
  - the next growth will be very strong, pruning and defoliation should be done in June to allow light inside the tree, with pinching after that to have short internodes
