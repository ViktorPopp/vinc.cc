# Pinus thunbergii (Japanese black pine)

## Propagation

### Seed

- Soak in warm water for 1 day
- Store 1 week at 5C
- Sow in spring
  - Use a tray with a mesh at the bottom like a pond basket
  - Use a draining mix with some water retention capacity
  - Put a mesh above the tray to protect from rodents and birds

## Development

### Year 1

- Spring
  - Sow the seeds as detailed above

### Year 2

- Spring
  - Repot the seedlings in small individual containers

- Fall
  - Wire the trunk to create movement (3 mm aluminum)
  - Remove all side buds at the top node except one to prevent shading the
    lower part of the tree and keep the central bud for the trunk extension
  - Thin out unnecessary needles for back budding to also prevent shading

### Year 3

- Spring
  - Repot from small container to pond basket to setup the roots
- Summer
  - Remove wire when it is starting to bite
- Fall
  - Thin out unnecessary needles and all except one side buds at the top of the
    tree like last year
  - Cut lower needles short
  - Wire and bend over the sacrificial branch to avoid shading the lower part
    of the tree
  - Prune lower branches that are too long or wait until decandling time next
    year

### Year 4

- Spring
  - Repot to the same pond basket to inspect and correct the roots

- Summer
  - Decandle lower branches

### Year 5

- Spring
  - Remove unnecessary branches

- Summer
  - Decandle lower branches

### Year 6

- Summer
  - Decandle or cut back lower branches

## Calendar

There are three periods in the year to work on black pines:

- Spring: repotting (when buds begin to swell)
- Summer: decandling (earlier in colder climate)
- Fall: thinning
