# Prehistory of Brittany

Some notes about the prehistory of Western Europe, mostly centered around the
region of Brittany in modern France.

## Foragers (Western Hunter Gatherers)

Some foragers arrived in Western Europe around 12000 BCE and replaced the
earlier Magdalenian culture.

- Epigravettian culture

## Farmers (Early European Farmers)

Some farmers arrived in Brittany around 5000 BCE, and in Britain around 4100
BCE where they mostly replaced the previous population of foragers.

The population declined at the end of the neolithic.

## Herders (Western Steppe Herders)

Some herders again mostly replaced the previous population around 2500 BCE in
Britain.

### Bell Beaker culture

- Early Bronze Age culture
- Started from Portugal and spread from the sea to form enclaves inland, like
  in the southern coast of Brittany
- From 2400 BCE to 1800 BCE in Britain

### Unetice culture

### Armorican Tumulus culture

- From 2200 BCE to 1400 BCE
- Atlantic Bronze Age culture, recently proposed to be at the origin of
  proto-Celtic
- 1200 BCE: Late Bronze Age collapse
- From 1300 BCE to 800 BCE: migration from Gaul into southern Britain, perhaps
  bringing Celtic to the island

A large number of Britons from Britain migrated to Brittany at the end of the
Roman period after the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons on the island around 500 CE.
