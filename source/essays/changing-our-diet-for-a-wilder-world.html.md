# Changing our diet for a wilder world

**Status:** early draft

This short essay explores how a [plant-based][0.0] or [vegan][0.1] diet could
drastically transform our [land use][0.2] to improve and protect biodiversity
by allowing the creation of new wilderness areas.

It focuses on Western Europe (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Liechtenstein,
Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Switzerland) using [data][0.3] from the Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, but it could be
transposed to other industrialized regions with the same conclusions.  All
tables were generated by a script published on [GitHub][0.4].

## Population

![Western Europe](/images/western-europe-gpw.png)
*Human density in Western Europe ([GPW v4.10](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-density-rev10))*

Western Europe was home to 191 million humans in 2013 and the population should
stabilize around 200 million by the year 2040. At the same time 573 million
chickens, 65 million pigs, and 42 million cattle, among other animals, were
raised in farms to feed the human population.

| Item                  | Population |
| --------------------- | ----------:|
| Humans                |     190.51 |
| Livestock             |     765.51 |
| .. Pigs               |      64.54 |
| .. Cattle             |      41.85 |
| .. Sheep              |      11.07 |
| .. Goats              |       2.04 |
| .. Chickens           |     572.72 |
| .. Turkeys            |      35.14 |
| .. Ducks              |      30.08 |
| .. Other              |       8.08 |

Over the past half a century the total number of poultry has been increasing
steadily whereas the number of cattle and sheep peaked 30 years ago.

During the same period the human population of Western Europe has become more
and more urban, with 78% of the people living in cities in 2013 compared to 69%
in 1963. In other words the rural population decreased by 9 million while the
urban population increased by 42 million.

## Land Use

![Western Europe](/images/western-europe-lwp.png)
*Human footprint on Western Europe ([LWP v3](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/wildareas-v3-2009-human-footprint))*

Western Europe has a land area of 109 million hectares. Most of it was covered
by deciduous trees before human settlement and the beginning of agriculture,
but nowadays the forests are reduced to 34 million hectares while crops and
pastures use 28 and 25 million hectares respectively.

| Item                                   |   Area |
| -------------------------------------- | ------:|
| Land                                   | 108.52 |
| .. Crops                               |  28.48 |
| ..\\... Permanent crops                |   1.35 |
| ..\\... Temporary crops                |  26.40 |
| ..\\... Fallow land                    |   0.74 |
| .. Pastures                            |  24.55 |
| ..\\... Permanent meadows and pastures |  17.83 |
| ..\\... Temporary meadows and pastures |   6.72 |
| .. Forests                             |  34.44 |
| ..\\... Primary forests                |   0.16 |
| ..\\... Planted forests                |   9.97 |
| ..\\... Naturally regenerated forests  |  24.31 |
| .. Other                               |  21.05 |

The pastures are grazed by cattle, sheep, and goats, while most chickens and
pigs are kept indoors. Crops produce food for both humans and their livestock.

A closer look at the current forests shows that there is virtually
[no wilderness left][2.0] in Western Europe, it is one of the most endangered
ecosystem in the world. The vast majority of the remaining forests are heavily
exploited and about a third of them are reduced to monoculture tree
plantations.

## Crops

The majority of the area used for crops is dedicated to the cultivation of
cereals. In 2013 more than 126 million tonnes of grain were harvested on less
than 18 million hectares. With 4 million more hectares dedicated to oils
production and less than 3 million for the remaining plants (fruits, roots,
vegetables).

| Item           |    Prod |    Area |
| -------------- | -------:| -------:|
| Crops          |  269.31 |   25.38 |
| .. Cereals     |  125.79 |   17.56 |
| .. Oils        |   12.60 |    4.03 |
| .. Fruits      |   13.12 |    1.18 |
| .. Sugars      |   71.84 |    0.95 |
| .. Roots       |   27.65 |    0.67 |
| .. Vegetables  |   16.13 |    0.51 |
| .. Pulses      |    1.10 |    0.32 |
| .. Fibres      |    0.55 |    0.08 |
| .. Nuts        |    0.08 |    0.04 |
| .. Spices      |    0.03 |    0.02 |
| .. Drinks      |    0.41 |    0.01 |
| .. Other       |    0.02 |    0.01 |

**NOTE:** The area of crops on this table (25M hectares) differs from the
previous table (28M hectares), see: [QC Methodology (FAOSTAT)][3.0]

The next table details the allocation of each type of crops to human food
(processed or directly) and to livestock feed. As before, the numbers are
expressed in million of tonnes.

| Item           |    Prod |  Supply |    Proc |    Food |    Feed |   Other |
| -------------- | -------:| -------:| -------:| -------:| -------:| -------:|
| Crops          |  303.17 |  315.21 |  111.00 |  100.82 |   65.44 |   38.23 |
| .. Cereals     |  125.96 |  104.03 |    9.70 |   22.05 |   60.52 |   11.76 |
| .. Sugars      |   71.82 |   72.15 |   66.43 |    0.00 |    0.00 |    5.72 |
| .. Roots       |   27.61 |   20.32 |    0.92 |   11.99 |    1.77 |    5.64 |
| .. Drinks      |   24.57 |   24.24 |    0.85 |   21.36 |    0.00 |    2.04 |
| .. Oils        |   21.78 |   40.55 |   24.87 |    4.27 |    1.99 |    9.58 |
| .. Vegetables  |   17.02 |   21.42 |    0.00 |   18.72 |    0.40 |    2.36 |
| .. Fruits      |   13.25 |   29.92 |    8.24 |   20.66 |    0.00 |    1.05 |
| .. Pulses      |    1.09 |    1.21 |    0.00 |    0.40 |    0.76 |    0.06 |
| .. Nuts        |    0.07 |    1.16 |    0.00 |    1.15 |    0.00 |    0.02 |
| .. Spices      |    0.00 |    0.20 |    0.00 |    0.22 |    0.00 |    0.00 |

**NOTE:** Some items on this table differ from the previous table. For example
beers and wines are now excluded from cereals and fruits respectively and
counted in drinks.

Most of the crops used to feed livestock are cereals. Of the 104 million tonnes
available in the domestic supply, about 1/3 goes to human food and 2/3 to
livestock feed.

Furthermore, as supply is defined by production and import subtracted by export
and changes in stocks, assuming the same balance for the 126 million tonnes of
cereals produced, we can estimate that about 11 million hectares of cereal
crops out of 18 according to the previous table were used to feed livestock.

## Diet

When we look at the food supply (in kcal/capita/day) we see that animal and
vegetal products represent respectively 1/3 and 2/3 of the current diet in
Western Europe:

| Item                     | Calories |
| ------------------------ | --------:|
| Animal Products          |     1109 |
| .. Meat                  |      514 |
| .. Dairy                 |      492 |
| .. Eggs                  |       49 |
| .. Seafood               |       54 |
| Vegetal Products         |     2387 |
| .. Cereals               |      882 |
| .. Oil                   |      483 |
| .. Sugar                 |      431 |
| .. Drinks                |      219 |
| .. Fruits                |      117 |
| .. Roots                 |      114 |
| .. Vegetables            |       74 |
| .. Nuts                  |       40 |
| .. Pulses                |       19 |
| .. Other                 |        8 |

In terms of calories available to humans, converting pastures and crops to
animal products is much less efficient than directly consuming those crops in
the first place.

It should be noted that some of the land used for pastures is not suitable for
growing crops, but with 2/3 of the crops in Western Europe used to feed
livestock, and the 1/3 remaining providing 2/3 of the calories consumed by the
human population, more than enough crops area is available to replace all
animal products with vegetable products.

Plant-based diets have a [long history][4.0] around the world and the modern
widespread availability of dietary supplements (vitamin B12 most notably)
means that a strict vegan diet, [properly planned][4.1], can be as healthy as
any omnivore diets.

## Conclusion

If all the human population of Western Europe shifted to a plant-based diet,
most of the 25 million hectares of pasture and at least a third of the 28
million hectares of crops that are used to feed the livestock could be freed
from agriculture while the remaining cropland would be reorganized to
prioritize direct human consumption.

The result of this change, after rewilding the land, could double the amount of
forests and provide a lot of the space required to protect biodiversity.

A full conversion of the population to a plant-based diet may seems utopian at
the moment, but even a moderate shift toward less meat consumption would
progressively allow the creation of more natural reserves.

## Annexes

Below are the same tables generated for the whole world (FAOSTAT 2013), mostly
equivalent to this great [data visualization][6.0] from [Our World In
Data][6.1].

In less industrialized areas there are more remaining forests, crops take less
space than pastures and are less used to feed the livestock, and humans eat
less animal products. But the population is still growing and adopting more and
more a lifestyle similar to Western Europe.
