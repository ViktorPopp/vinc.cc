Today I put some content on [vinua.com][1], the website of my web consulting
business. I was about time, I've been freelancing full time since 2015 but
I had no online presence except for this personal website and my LinkedIn
account.

In the meantime I've been using [vinua.net][2] a lot more for my servers on
various cloud providers and a few days ago I purchased [vinua.fr][3] because
the business is registered in France. Both domains are configured to redirect
all traffic to [vinua.com][1], so it's better to have something to show.
