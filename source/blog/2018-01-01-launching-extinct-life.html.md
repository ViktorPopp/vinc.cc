# Launching extinct.life

Today is the first day of the year 2018 and I decided to start a [new blog][1]
where every week we'll pick an extinct species and learn about the causes of
its disappearance.

The [sixth mass extinction][2] is ongoing. We must stop it and protect
biodiversity. A website alone won't do much of course, but it's an opportunity
to learn more about the problem and talk about it on social media.
