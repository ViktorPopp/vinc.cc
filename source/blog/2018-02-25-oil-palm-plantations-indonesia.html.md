A [recent study published in Current Biology][1] estimates that more than 100
000 Bornean orangutans were lost between 1999 and 2015, with most severe
declines occurring in areas in which habitat was removed. Bornean orangutans
are [critically endangered][2] and this loss represents half of their
population.

Everything that is red in the following map centered on Summatra, another
island of Indonesia, are forests that have been cut down between 2000 and 2016.

The forests have been replaced by [oil palm plantations][3].

We can use Google Maps to see them. Zoom in to see the straight lines of palm
trees, zoom out to have an idea of the scale of those plantations. And take a
look around in Google Street View.

They are quite easy to spot by their uniformity. The biodiversity loss is
catastrophic.

The satellite and ground coverage of Google Maps is pretty good on both
islands. The above locations where picked more or less at random.

Google Earth is also interesting to see older satellite pictures and notice the
same pattern happening over and over again: first a road is built to cross a
primary forest, smaller tracks then appears perpendicular to the road, and very
soon after that the forest is cut down. Finally, some time later, oil palm
plantations appears.

I encourage everyone reading this to have a look for themselves, and think
about it next time they read "palm oil" in a list of ingredients.
