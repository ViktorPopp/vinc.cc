# Oil palm plantations in Indonesia

A [recent study published in Current Biology][1] estimates that more than
100,000 Bornean orangutans were lost between 1999 and 2015, with most severe
declines occurring in areas in which habitat was removed. Bornean orangutans
are [critically endangered][2] and this loss represents half of their
population.

Deforestation is affecting all the islands of the region. Summatra, the
largest island of Indonesia, home to orangutans, elephants, rhinoceros, and
tigers, has lost almost half of its tropical rainforest in the last 35 years. 

The following map of Summatra covers a rectangular area 175 kilometers wide by
100 kilometers. The red color indicates the forests that have been cut down
between 2000 and 2016. Click on the image to open Google Earth Engine, and zoom
out to see the extend of the loss.

The forests have been replaced by [oil palm plantations][3] providing about
half of the global world supply of palm oil.

The satellite pictures on this page come from Google Maps. Click on any of them
and zoom in to see the straight lines of palm trees, zoom out to see of the
scale of the plantations. And take a look around the same areas from the ground
with Google Street View.

The oil palm plantations are quite easy to spot by their uniformity. It's a
[monoculture][4] on a massive scale, the biodiversity loss is catastrophic.

The satellite and ground coverage of Google Maps is pretty good on both the
islands of Borneo and Summatra. The above locations where picked more or less
at random.

I encourage everyone reading this to have a look for themselves, and to think
about it next time they read "palm oil" in a list of ingredients.
