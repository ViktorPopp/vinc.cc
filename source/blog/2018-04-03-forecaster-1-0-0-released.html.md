# Forecaster 1.0.0 released

This weekend I finally published on [rubygems.org][1] the [changes][2] that have
been accumulating over the past two years in the [repository][3] of Forecaster.

Forecaster is a ruby gem using `wgrib2` to fetch and read weather data directly
from the [Global Forecast System][4] instead of using the API of a website.
