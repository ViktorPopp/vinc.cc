# Hakituri News redesigned

[![Hakituri News](/images/hakituri-news-background.jpg)][3]

Today is [Earth Day][1] and to mark it I decided to take a little break from
the development of [Picture][2] to improve the design of [Hakituri News][3].

Hakituri means "mythical forest guardians" in Maori and the living beings on
Earth could do with more protectors. [Hakituri News][3] is a news aggregator
focused on the environment and the climate of our planet and dedicated to alert
and educate people to protect biodiversity.

I started this project almost a year ago to collect the links found on
[Reddit][4], [Wikipedia][5], and various websites through my more generalist
[news aggregator][6]. It's a very basic rails app and I simply reused the
design from this last website.

Over the year I managed to keep posting regularly and I often thought that this
project deserved a bit more attention and a less sober face. So today I finally
took some time to put a cover image in the background, from one of the most
beautiful and preserved places of Aotearoa (New Zealand), and I customised a
little the cards of the news feed. Each news will now also have its own page.

I'm not yet completely happy with this new design but for a couple hours of
work it's already a good improvement.

And now back to [Picture][2] (more on that later).
