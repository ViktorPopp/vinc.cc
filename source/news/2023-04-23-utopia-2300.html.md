# Utopia 2300

A few weeks ago I asked [ChatGPT][1] and [OpenJourney][2] to halucinate for us
a future from the year 2300, two centuries after human population peaked, where
half of the land was set aside for nature and humans became steward of the land
after organizing themselves into post-scarcity anarchist communities.

Today I'm publishing the hundred of images that resulted from this experiment
at https://utopia.vinc.cc/
