# Updating the website

I started the current iteration of this personal website with the idea to have
a blog where I would write short posts, and an essays section where I would
write in a more longer form, but I don't really like the pressure to produce
content they both create. This resulted in a lot of procrastination and often
months goes by without any updates.

So I decided instead to simply have [pages](/pages) where I would write content
whenever I feel like it, and I am now in the process of moving everything
there. This will also improve the organization of this content because the
variety of subjects I'm interested in is probably too random for my
hypothetical readership.

The blog will remain as a changelog to keep track of updates, and I will also
use it as previously to publish announcements because I'm drastically reducing
my social media usage, especially on the big centralized platforms.
