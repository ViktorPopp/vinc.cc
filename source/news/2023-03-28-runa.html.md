# Managing a chess engine cluster with Runa

![Rack](rack.jpg)

## Chess engine cluster

Now that two children are living at the house I installed some electric heaters
in the rooms that we are using before the winter but when the temperatures got
cold I needed something for the main room that we are not using yet.

Instead of installing another two heaters there I decided to buy a couple of
old Dell PowerEdge R710 servers and move them in a StarTech 18U rack with two
Eaton UPS, a TP-Link TL-SG1024 switch, and my old Sun Fire V20z servers.

I bought two Intel Xeon X5650 processors (12 threads at 2.66 GHz) and replaced
some failed RAM sticks in one of the server (that I got for free) to bring the
total to 144GB of RAM.

With that much computing power, and new electrical system for the house that I
started installing last summer, I was finally able to properly test new
versions of my chess engine [Little Wing][1].

Indeed for every change to the code I need to run tens of thousand of very
short games against other chess engines to see if the change is positive or
negative. That takes a lot of time, even on many threads.

At first I used SSH and Screen to run a script that would launch the games on
the two servers but this got old pretty fast. I needed to automate the process.

## Runa

So I started working on [Runa][2], a Ruby on Rails app to run scripts on
multiple servers and get the results from anywhere (web, email,
integrations...).

The interface is quite simple but easy to use and just what I need for my chess
engine. It might also be interesting for other people, we'll see. And instead
of running on premise it could also easily run in the cloud and launch virtual
machines to run the scripts.

I created a domain for the app at [runa.sh][2] and published the code on
[GitHub][3] with a MIT licence.

BTW: the cluster is working very well to heat up the room in winter but I'll
have to shut it down in summer. I can see a new habit forming where I'll work
on my chess engine every winter to help warming up the house.
