# Quercus robur #1

## 2020-03 Collected from the garden

This oak was too close from the house to be allowed to grow freely. A lot of
them are in a similar situation and I think in the past the previous owners
would cut them back to ground level every now and then. Some are even producing
acorns, so this may have been going on for a while.

There's only a few centimeters of soil before reaching the rocks below the
surface in front of the house, so it's a bit hard to dig the oaks with a big
taper root. This one had a good amount of lateral roots so I took my time
to carefully reach the taper, cut it with a saw, and then it was easy to [lift
the tree](/bonsai/2020-03-31-quercus-robur-1-during-collection.jpg).

## 2020-07 Growing

The tree reacted well enough from going into a pot. The second flush of leaves
were infected by powdered mildew, as most oaks are around here, but a potassium
bicarbonate treatment it received in July was effective and the tree produced a
big third flush in August.

The plan is to let it grow for a while and reduce the remaining of the taper
root during the next repotting while cutting back the trunk.
