# Olea europaea #1

## 2005-05 Acquisition

In 2005 I visited for the first time a bonsai exposition at Plourhan in
Brittany and came back with this olive tree.

A month later I put it into a pot and wired the branches to make them start
from the tree more horizontally, except for the top one that was to be used
as the trunk leader.

It didn't look good but the idea was to later cut back all the branches closer
to the trunk and develop the secondary ramification.

## 2007-05 Very slowly

This tree was quite slow to grow, despite good watering and feeding. The
location may be too much north for olive trees as they don't grow in the
wild around here.

A few year later I finally cut back the branches closer to the trunk and
the year before that I had selected a new trunk leader.

In the previous years I was studying at a university just a couple of hours
away from the garden of my parents where my trees were growing but I moved to
the capital of the country for work in 2011 and to the other side of the world
a few years later. I came back a couple of years after that but I took me a few
more years to finally have a place to grow some trees again. It's incredible
how fast a decade can come and go.

During those years the tree got only basic watering care and the secondary
ramification didn't develop. Instead all the leaves are quite far from the
trunk and a few branches died including the first one on the right side. The
plan is to remove the top branch, wire the other to get them closer to
horizontal again, and feed the tree well until next year when it'll be more
than time to repot it.

There is very little to show for 15 years in the garden but the trunk was nice
to begin with and got even nicer. The two successive branches at the top did
a good job at improving the tapering. Now, as it was at the beginning, the tree
only need some good lateral branches.
