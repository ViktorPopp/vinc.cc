This is the second of three itoigawa junipers that I ordered from
[Maillot Bonsai](https://www.maillot-bonsai.com), near Lyon in the Southeast of France,
to experiment with junipers and propagate them via cuttings in the coming
years.

They were 5 years old and already a bit too tick for the kind of very compacted
shape I had in mind for them, but if I let them grow large enough they should
be okay.

This one was a bit thinner than the [first one](/bonsai/collection/juniperus-chinensis-itoigawa-1)
I wired a week ago but I still couldn't bend the first part of the trunk as
much as I wanted. Another part slightly cracked at one place up in the tree,
we'll see how the top of the tree react to that.
