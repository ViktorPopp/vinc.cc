This 12 years old pre-bonsai was ordered from [Bonsai Plaza](https://www.bonsaiplaza.com)
in the Netherlands. It was originally imported from Japan.

The tree did very well during the growing season but the branches I cut during
the summer that didn't manage to take root. It never ceased completely to
flower after the winter and it started again to flower in full force in the
fall.
