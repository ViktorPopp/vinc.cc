This 20 years old pre-bonsai was ordered from [Bonsai Plaza](https://www.bonsaiplaza.com)
in the Netherlands. It was originally imported from Korea.

## August 2021

The tree got a slow start, maybe due to freezing conditions until the end of
the first week of May. For the next few months the leaves were very small and
unhealthy but as the weather warmed up it started growing very well with strong
shoots.

## November 2021

I let it grow the whole season and pruned it after leaf fall to remove all the
unnecessary branches and shorten the rest.

I will let it grow again a lot next year to improve the scars and thicken the
main branches.
