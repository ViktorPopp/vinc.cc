This 6 years old pre-bonsai was ordered from [Bonsai Plaza](https://www.bonsaiplaza.com)
in the Netherlands. It was originally imported from Japan.

## Mars 2021

I repotted the tree in a pond basket in a mix of 90% kanuma and 10% pumice
after cutting all its big roots.

## May 2021

The flower buds are expending since the end of April and getting their colors
in the middle of May:

And two weeks later the tree is almost in full bloom:
