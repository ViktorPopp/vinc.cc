This 15 years old pre-bonsai was ordered from [Mistral Bonsai](https://www.mistralbonsai.com)
near Tarragona in the Northeast of Spain.

## March 2021

It was repotted in March in a mix of pine bark, lava, and pumice.

## May 2021

It grew well since the repotting and was in full bloom in May from the few
flower buds left.

## June 2021

In June it was still growing strongly so I removed all the branches that would
not be needed in the final design and worked the ugly scars.

## August 2021

It responded very well to the pruning and kept growing vigorously.
