This is the first of three itoigawa junipers that I bought for propagation by
cuttings to get enough material in the following years to experiment with the
species.

They were 5 years old and already a bit too tick for the kind of compacted
shape I had in mind for them, although they grew slowly in very small pots.

This one was ticker than the others, without any first branch that could
replace the main trunk, so I picked it up first to wire it and see how it'd go.

The result was not too bad. The other two were then planned to get wired a few
weeks after seeing how this one react.
