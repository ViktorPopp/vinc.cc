# Powdery mildew

![Powdery mildew on oak](/images/bonsai/powdery-mildew.jpg)

Powdery mildew can be found on the new leaves of oak trees during the summer.
It is caused by a fungus called [Erysiphe alphitoides][1] and weaken trees
by affecting the ability of leaves to photosynthesize.

Spraying the leaves with 5g potassium bicarbonate, 5g of olive oil, and 1 drop
of liquid soap dilluted in 1L of water seems effective at controlling the
infestation.
