# Prunus spinosa #1

## 2020-03 Collected from the garden

There's a few area in the garden where blackthorn are densely growing and must
be managed to avoid colonising all the surrounding land. This is a great
opportunity to collect bonsai material.

## 2020-08 Growing

Early August I cut the [suckers from the base of the trunk](/bonsai/2020-07-17-prunus-spinosa-1.jpg),
but so far the tree hasn't produced a second flush of leaves like many did
around the garden, although it is full of buds.
