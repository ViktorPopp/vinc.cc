# Bonsai Journal 2020


## 2020-08-19

Some green is starting to appear on some buds of Prunus spinosa #1, a new
flush is in preparation.

The old leaves of Ficus retusa #1 are turning black, it seems they are all
burned from the sun. Not sure if it's due to watering too late in the morning
or the quick succession of rain and sun around noon in the past week, or simply
that those leaves formed in winter and one months of full sun slowly burned
them and it's only now that it's quite visible.


## 2020-08-17

Put organic fertilizer on every tree.


## 2020-08-12

Received 3 young unstyled Juniperus chinensis itoigawa and styled [one of them](/bonsai/juniperus-chinensis-itoigawa-1)
to see how it will react.


## 2020-08-10

The leaves of the 6 young Acer palmatum received last month quickly burned in
the partial sun until I put them in a completely shaded location, but most of
them are now going back from a dark red color to a more healthy green color, at
least those that are not too burned. Another good news is that some of them are
producing new leaves.


## 2020-08-08

Collected cuttings from 2 hawthorns in the garden.

The Ficus retusa #1 is finally showing signs of creating new leaves after
being repoted 3 weeks ago. It was very weak, that's probably why the cuttings
are not working. Hopefully it'll get better with the new substrate and room
to grow roots along with plenty of watering and feeding.


## 2020-08-04

The leaves of the 4 Ficus retusa cuttings seems to all be dying at the same
time, even with the 2 where the pot was constantly immersed in water. I put
3 of them inside a plastic bag.


## 2020-07-28

Tightened the plastic bags around the air layering of the apple trees, only one
of them has taken root so far. Most probably dried up too much.

Received potassium bicarbonate and sprayed the oak trees that had severe
powdered mildew infestation, along with the maple and the hornbeam trees as a
preventive. Used 1L of water, 5g of potassium bicarbonate, 5g of olive oil, and
1 drop of liquid soap.

The Prunus spinosa #2, that made almost no leaves after being taken from the
ground because it has almost no roots, is now making a lot of new leaves 4
months later.


## 2020-07-26

Cut the top branch of Olea europa #1 and wired other branches to move them
closer to the horizontal plan.

The top branch was transformed into two cuttings.


## 2020-07-23

Cleaned by hand the leaves of the oak trees that were infested with powdered
mildew with water, sodium bicarbonate, olive oil, and soap.


## 2020-07-22

Received organic fertilizer and put it on every trees.


## 2020-07-17

Repotted Ficus retusa #1 and cut the top branches that provided three cuttings.

Crataegus monogyna.
