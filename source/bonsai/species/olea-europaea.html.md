Olea europaea is a good species for beginners. Wild olives, Olea europaea
sylvestris, are particularly suited to bonsai due to their smaller leaves.

There are a variety of guides on the internet with contradictory informations
on how to grow the olive as bonsai, probably due to the differences in climate
from its Mediterranean native region. A good rule of thumbs is to dismiss
guides advising to bring the trees inside heated houses during winter.

This species has a peculiar fine root system that grows slowly and don't need
frequent repotting, as a consequence the substrate must be very stable to avoid
compacting with time. It must also be very draining because the trees don't
like the combination of cold and wet soil. Therefor a mix of pumice and
pozzolan is well suited. There is less consensus for the best time for
repotting, some advise to do it just before spring begin and some prefer the
end of spring or early summer when the trees are already growing. The latter
opinion seem correlated to locations in colder climates.

  - old is not our worst enemy
  - the big problem is the combination of cold and wet
  - trees that are overwintered in the dry will grow much more strongly in summer
  - if you do have to re-pot an olive the ONLY time to do this is mid-summer
  - olives re-potted in spring tend to produce poor subsequent growth in that year and then return to normal in the following year
  - choose a hot period between mid June and mid July
  - don't prune growth prior to re-potting the tree needs all the leaf mass it can get
  - growing media should be alkaline, olives naturally grow on limestone
  - 80% graded Pumice - 10% Moler clay - 10% clean chipped pine bark
  - use any high quality organic fertiliser so long as it incorporates multiple nutrient sources
  - when pruning an olive to build ramification it is important to cut all new shoots at the same time
