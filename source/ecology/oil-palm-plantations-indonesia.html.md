# Oil palm plantations in Indonesia

A [recent study][0] published in [Current Biology][1] estimates that more
than 100,000 Bornean orangutans were lost between 1999 and 2015, with the most
severe declines occurring in areas in which habitat was removed. Bornean
orangutans are now [critically endangered][2].

Deforestation is affecting all of Indonesia. The island of Sumatra, the sixth
largest island of the planet, home to orangutans, elephants, rhinoceros, and
tigers, [has lost almost half of its tropical rainforest][3] between 1990 and
2010.

The following map of Sumatra covers a rectangular area 175 kilometers wide by
100 kilometers. The red color indicates the forests that have been cut down
between 2000 and 2016 ([Hansen/UMD/Google/USGS/NASA][4]).

extend of the loss.

The forests have been replaced by [oil palm plantations][5] providing about
half of the global world supply of palm oil.

The satellite pictures on this page come from Google Maps. Click on any of them
and zoom in to see the straight lines of palm trees, zoom out to see of the
scale of the plantations. And take a look around the same areas from the ground
with Google Street View.

The oil palm plantations are easy to spot from space with their uniformity and
long straight roads. This [monoculture][6] on a massive scale has [catastrophic
effects][7] on biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions, and indigenous
communities.

The satellite and ground coverage of Google Maps is pretty good on both the
islands of Borneo and Sumatra. The above locations where picked more or less at
random.

I encourage everyone reading this to have a look for themselves, and to think
about it next time they read "palm oil" in a list of ingredients.
